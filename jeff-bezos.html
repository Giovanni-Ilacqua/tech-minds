                Jeffrey Preston Bezos (January 12, 1964) is an American technology entrepreneur, investor, and
                philanthropist. He is best known as the founder, chairman, and <strong> chief executive officer of Amazon.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Bezos was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico and raised in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Princeton
                University in
                1986 with degrees in electrical engineering and computer science. He worked on Wall Street in a variety of
                related
                fields from 1986 to early 1994. He founded Amazon in late 1994 on a cross-country road trip from New York
                City to
                Seattle. The company began as an online bookstore and has expanded to a variety of products and services,
                including
                video and audio streaming. It is currently the world's largest online sales company, as well as the world's
                largest
                provider of cloud infrastructure services via its Amazon Web Services arm.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bezos added to his business interests when he founded aerospace company Blue Origin in 2000. A Blue Origin
                test
                flight successfully first reached space in 2015 and Blue has plans to begin commercial suborbital human
                spaceflight
                as early as late 2018. He purchased The Washington Post in 2013 for US$250 million in cash. Bezos manages
                other
                business investments through his venture capital fund, Bezos Expeditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                On July 27, 2017, he became the world's wealthiest person when his estimated net worth increased to just
                over $90
                billion. His wealth surpassed $100 billion for the first time on November 24, he was formally designated
                the
                wealthiest person in the world by Forbes on March 6, 2018 with a net worth of $112 billion. The first
                centi-billionaire on the Forbes wealth index, he was designated the "wealthiest person in modern history"
                after his
                net worth increased to <em> $150 billion in July 2018. </em>

                <p>
                    Bezos was born Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen on January 12, 1964, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the son of
                    Jacklyn Gise
                    Jorgensen and Chicago native Ted Jorgensen. At the time of his birth, his mother was a 17-year-old high
                    school
                    student and his father was a bike shop owner. After Jacklyn divorced Ted, she married Cuban immigrant
                    Miguel "Mike"
                    Bezos in April 1968. Shortly after the wedding, Mike adopted four-year-old Jorgensen, whose surname was
                    then
                    changed to Bezos. The family moved to Houston, Texas, where Mike worked as an engineer for Exxon after he
                    received
                    a degree from the University of New Mexico. Bezos attended River Oaks Elementary School in Houston from
                    fourth to
                    sixth grade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bezos was the maternal grandson of Lawrence Preston Gise, a regional director of the U.S. Atomic Energy
                    Commission
                    (AEC) in Albuquerque. Gise retired early to his family's ranch near Cotulla, Texas, where Bezos would spend
                    many
                    summers in his youth. Bezos would later purchase this ranch and grow it from 25,000 acres to 300,000 acres.
                    His
                    maternal grandmother was Mattie Louise Gise (née Strait), through whom he is a cousin of country singer
                    George
                    Strait. Bezos often displayed scientific interests and technological proficiency; he once rigged an
                    electric alarm
                    to keep his younger siblings out of his room.

                <p>
                    The family moved to Miami, Florida, where Bezos attended Miami Palmetto High School. While Bezos was in
                    high
                    school, he worked at McDonald's as a short-order line cook during the breakfast shift. He attended the
                    Student
                    Science Training Program at the University of Florida where he received a Silver Knight Award in 1982. He
                    was high
                    school valedictorian and a National Merit Scholar. In 1986, he graduated from Princeton University with a
                    4.2 grade
                    point average and Bachelor of Science degrees in electrical engineering and computer science and was a
                    member of
                    Phi Beta Kappa. While at Princeton, he was also elected to Tau Beta Pi and was the president of the
                    Princeton
                    chapter of the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After Bezos graduated from Princeton in 1987, he was offered jobs at Intel, Bell Labs, and Andersen
                    Consulting,
                    among others. He first worked at Fitel, a financial telecommunications start-up, where he was tasked with
                    building
                    a network for international trade. Bezos was promoted to head of development and director of customer
                    service
                    thereafter. He transitioned into the banking industry when he became a product manager at Bankers Trust; he
                    worked
                    there from 1988 to 1990. He then joined D. E. Shaw & Co, a newly founded hedge fund, in 1990. He worked
                    there until
                    1994 and, at age 30, became its fourth senior vice-president.

                    Amazon.com, Inc., doing business as Amazon, is an American electronic commerce and cloud computing company
                    based in
                    Seattle, Washington, that was founded by Jeff Bezos on July 5, 1994. The tech giant is the largest Internet
                    retailer in the world as measured by revenue and market capitalization, and second largest after Alibaba
                    Group in
                    terms of total sales. The amazon.com website started as an online bookstore and later diversified to sell
                    video
                    downloads/streaming, MP3 downloads/streaming, audiobook downloads/streaming, software, video games,
                    electronics,
                    apparel, furniture, food, toys, and jewelry. The company also produces consumer electronics—Kindle
                    e-readers, Fire
                    tablets, Fire TV, and Echo—and is the world's largest provider of cloud infrastructure services (IaaS and
                    PaaS).
                    Amazon also sells certain low-end products under its in-house brand AmazonBasics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Amazon has separate retail websites for the United States, the United Kingdom and Ireland, France, Canada,
                    Germany,
                    Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Australia, Brazil, Japan, China, India, Mexico, Singapore, and Turkey. In 2016,
                    Dutch,
                    Polish, and Turkish language versions of the German Amazon website were also launched. Amazon also offers
                    international shipping of some of its products to certain other countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2015, Amazon surpassed Walmart as the most valuable retailer in the United States by market
                    capitalization.
                    Amazon is the second most valuable public company in the world (behind only Apple), the largest Internet
                    company by
                    revenue in the world, and after Walmart, the second largest employer in the United States. In 2017, Amazon
                    acquired
                    Whole Foods Market for $13.4 billion, which vastly increased Amazon's presence as a brick-and-mortar
                    retailer. The
                    acquisition was interpreted by some as a direct attempt to challenge Walmart's traditional retail stores.
                    In 2018,
                    for the first time, Jeff Bezos released in Amazon's shareholder letter the number of Amazon Prime
                    subscribers,
                    which is 100 million worldwide. On September 4, 2018, Amazon reached $1 trillion in value, becoming the
                    second
                    publicly traded US company to do so after Apple.

            Bezos first became a millionaire in 1997 after raising $54 million through Amazon's initial public offering
            (IPO).
            He was first included on Forbes The World's Billionaires list in 1999 with a registered net worth of $10.1
            billion.
            His net worth decreased to $6.1 billion a year later, a 40.5% drop. His wealth plummeted even more the
            following
            year, dropping 66.6% to $2.0 billion. He lost $500 million the following year, which brought his net worth
            down to
            $1.5 billion. The following year, his net worth increased by 104% to $2.5 billion. From 2005 to 2007, he
            quadrupled
            his net worth to $8.7 billion. After the financial crisis and succeeding economic recession, his net worth
            would
            erode $6.8 billion—a 17.7% drop. His wealth rose by 85.2% in 2010, leaving him with $12.6 billion. This
            percentage
            increase ascended him to the 43rd spot on the ranking from 68th.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a rumor broke out that Amazon was developing a smartphone, Bezos's net worth rose to $30.5 billion in
            2014. A
            year later, Bezos entered the top ten when he increased his net worth to a total of $50.3 billion. Bezos
            rose to be
            the 5th richest person in the world hours before market close; he gained $7 billion in one hour. By the
            time the
            Forbes list was calculated in March 2016, his net worth was registered at $45.2 billion. However, just
            months later
            in October 2016, his wealth increased by $16.2 billion to $66.5 billion unofficially ranking him the third
            richest
            person in the world behind Warren Buffett. After sporadic jumps in Amazon's share price, in July 2017 he
            briefly
            unseated Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates as the wealthiest person in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bezos would continue to sporadically surpass Gates throughout the month of October 2017 after Amazon's
            share price
            fluctuated. His net worth surpassed $100 billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, after Amazon's
            share
            price increased by more than 2.5%. When the 2017 list was issued, Bezos's net worth was registered at $72.8
            billion, adding $27.6 billion from the previous year. Bezos was officially ranked as the third wealthiest
            person in
            the world up from the 5th spot in 2016. His wealth's rapid growth from 2016 to 2017 sparked a variety of
            assessments about how much money Bezos earned on a controlled, reduced time scale. On October 10, 2017, he
            made an
            estimated $6.24 billion in 5 minutes, slightly less than the annual Gross Domestic Product of Kyrgyzstan.
        </p>
        <p>
            On March 6, 2018, Bezos was officially designated the wealthiest person in the world with a registered net
            worth of
            $112 billion. He unseated Bill Gates ($90 billion) who was $6 billion ahead of Warren Buffett ($84
            billion), ranked
            third. He is considered the first registered centi-billionaire (not adjusted for inflation).
        </p>
        <p>
            His wealth, in 2017–18 terms, equaled that of 2.7 million Americans. Bezos's net worth increased by $33.6
            billion
            from January 2017 to January 2018. This increase outstripped the economic development (in GDP terms) of
            more than
            96 countries around the world. During March 9, Bezos earned $230,000 every 60-seconds. The Motley Fool
            estimated
            that if Bezos had not sold any of his shares from its original public offering in 1997, his net worth would
            sit at
            $181 billion in 2018. According to Quartz, his net worth of $150 billion in July 2018 was enough to
            purchase the
            entire stock markets of Nigeria, Hungary, Egypt, Luxembourg, and Iran. Following the report by Quartz,
            Amazon
            workers in Poland, Germany, and Spain participated in demonstrations and labor strikes to draw awareness to
            his
            growing wealth and the lack of compensation, labor rights, and satisfactory working conditions of select
            Amazon
            workers. On July 17, 2018 he was designated the “wealthiest person in modern history” by the Bloomberg
            Billionaires
            Index, Fortune, MarketWatch, The Wall Street Journal, and Forbes.
