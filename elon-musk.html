            </div>
            <p>
                Elon Reeve Musk born June 28, 1971) is a business magnate and investor. He holds South African, Canadian, and U.S. citizenship and is the founder, CEO, and lead designer of SpaceX; co-founder, CEO, and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; co-founder and CEO of Neuralink; and co-founder of PayPal. In December 2016, he was ranked 21st on the Forbes list of The World's Most <strong>Powerful</strong> People. As of August 2018, he has a net worth of $19.8 billion and is listed by Forbes as the 46th-richest person in the world.
            </p>

            <p>
                In May 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and lead designer. He helped fund Tesla, Inc., an electric vehicle and solar panel manufacturer, in 2003, and became its CEO and product architect. In 2006, he inspired the creation of SolarCity, a solar energy services company that is now a subsidiary of Tesla, and operates as its chairman. In 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that aims to promote friendly artificial intelligence. In July 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces, and is its CEO. In December 2016, Musk founded The Boring Company, an infrastructure and tunnel-construction company. At age 17, in 1989, Elon Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen's University and avoid mandatory service in the South African military. He left in 1992 to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania. He graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a second bachelor's degree in physics. After leaving Penn, Elon Musk headed to Stanford University in California to pursue a PhD in energy physics. However, his move was timed perfectly with the Internet boom, and he dropped out of Stanford after just two days to become a part of it, launching his first company, Zip2 Corporation.

            <h3>Growing Up</h3>
                <img class="img-float" src="images/elon2.jpg" alt="Elon Money Man">
            <p>
                Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa,the son of Maye Musk, a model and dietitian
                from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, and Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, and sailor.
                He has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974). His paternal grandmother was
                British, and he also has Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. His maternal grandfather Joshua Haldeman was American, from
                Minnesota. After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in the suburbs of Pretoria, which
                Musk chose two years after his parents split up, but now says was "not a good idea". As an adult, Musk has severed
                relations with his father. He has a half-sister,and half-brother.During his childhood, Musk was an avid reader. At
                age 10, he developed an interest in computing with the Commodore VIC-20. He taught himself computer programming at
                the age of 10, and by the age of 12 sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar, to a
                magazine called PC and Office Technology, for approximately $500. A web version of the game is available online.
            </p>
            <p>   
                His childhood reading included Isaac Asimov's Foundation series from which he drew the lesson that "you should try
                to take the set of actions that are likely to prolong civilization, minimize the probability of a dark age and
                reduce the length of a dark age if there is one." Musk was severely bullied throughout his childhood and was once
                hospitalized when a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs and then beat him until he lost consciousness.
                Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, and Bryanston High School before graduating from Pretoria Boys
                High School. Though Musk's father insisted that Elon go to college in Pretoria, Musk became determined to move to
                the United States. As he states, "I remember thinking and seeing that America is where great things are possible,
                more than any other country in the world." Knowing it would be easy to get to the United States from Canada, he
                moved to Canada against his father's wishes in June 1989, just before his 18th birthday, after obtaining a Canadian
                passport through his Canadian-born mother.

            </div>

            <div class="main-article">
                <h4>Zip2</h4>
                <p>
                    In 1995, Musk and his brother, Kimbal, started Zip2, a web software company, with money raised from a small
                    group of angel investors. The company developed and marketed an Internet "city guide" for the newspaper
                    publishing industry. Musk obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune and persuaded the
                    board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch. While at Zip2, Musk wanted to become CEO;
                    however, none of the board members would allow it.Compaq acquired Zip2 for US$307 million in cash and US$34
                    million in stock options[in February 1999. Musk received US$22 million for his 7 percent share from the sale.
                </p>
            
                <h4>X.com and Paypal</h4>
                <p>
                    In March 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company, with US $10
                    million from the sale of Zip2. One year later, the company merged with Confinity,which had a money-transfer
                    service called PayPal. The merged company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.
                    PayPal's early growth was driven mainly by a viral marketing campaign where new customers were recruited when
                    they received money through the service. Musk was ousted in October 2000 from his role as CEO (although he
                    remained on the board) due to disagreements with other company leadership, notably over his desire to move
                    PayPal's Unix-based infrastructure to Microsoft Windows. In October 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for
                    US$1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk received US$165 million. Before its sale, Musk, who was the company's
                    largest shareholder, owned 11.7% of PayPal's shares.
                    In July 2017, Musk purchased the domain x.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount stating that it has "great
                    sentimental value" to him.
                </p>
            
                <h4>SpaceX</h4>
                <p>
                    In 2001, Musk conceptualized "Mars Oasis", a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on Mars,
                    containing food crops growing on Martian regolith, in an attempt to regain public interest in space
                    exploration. In October 2001, Musk travelled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell (an aerospace supplies fixer), and
                    Adeo Ressi (his best friend from college), to buy refurbished Dnepr Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)
                    that could send the envisioned payloads into space. The group met with companies such as NPO Lavochkin and
                    Kosmotras; however, according to Cantrell, Musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the
                    Russian chief designers, and the group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group
                    returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs, bringing along Mike Griffin. Griffin had worked for the CIA's
                    venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel, as well as NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and was just leaving Orbital
                    Sciences, a maker of satellites and spacecraft. The group met again with Kosmotras, and were offered one rocket
                    for US $8 million; however, this was seen by Musk as too expensive; Musk consequently stormed out of the
                    meeting. On the flight back from Moscow, Musk realized that he could start a company that could build the
                    affordable rockets he needed. According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson, Musk calculated
                    that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the
                    time. It was concluded that theoretically, by applying vertical integration and the modular approach from
                    software engineering, SpaceX could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a 70-percent gross
                    margin. Ultimately, Musk ended up founding SpaceX with the long-term goal of creating a "true spacefaring
                    civilization.”
                    With US $100 million of his early fortune, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, in May 2002.
                    Musk is chief executive officer (CEO) and chief technology officer (CTO) of the Hawthorne, California-based
                    company. SpaceX develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket
                    technology. The company's first two launch vehicles are the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets (a nod to Star Wars'
                    Millennium Falcon), and its first spacecraft is the Dragon (a nod to Puff the Magic Dragon). In seven years,
                    SpaceX designed the family of Falcon launch vehicles and the Dragon multipurpose spacecraft. In September 2008,
                    SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket became the first privately funded liquid-fueled vehicle to put a satellite into Earth
                    orbit. On May 25, 2012, the SpaceX Dragon vehicle berthed with the ISS, making history as the first commercial
                    company to launch and berth a vehicle to the International Space Station.
                </p>
            
                <h4>Tesla</h4>
                <p>
                    Tesla, Inc. (originally Tesla Motors) was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who
                    financed the company until the Series A round of funding.
                    Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Elon Musk's involvement. Musk led the
                    Series A round of investment in February 2004, joining Tesla's board of directors as its chairman. Musk took an
                    active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level, but was not deeply
                    involved in day-to-day business operations.
                    Following the financial crisis in 2008 and after a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, Eberhard was ousted
                    from the firm. Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect, positions he still holds
                    today. Tesla Motors first built an electric sports car, the Tesla Roadster in 2008, with sales of about 2,500
                    vehicles to 31 countries. Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan on June 22, 2012. It unveiled its
                    third product, the Model X, aimed at the SUV/minivan market, on February 9, 2012; however, the Model X launch
                    was delayed until September 2015. In addition to its own cars, Tesla sells electric powertrain systems to
                    Daimler for the Smart EV, Mercedes B-Class Electric Drive and Mercedes A Class, and to Toyota for the RAV4 EV.
                    Musk was able to bring in both companies as long-term investors in Tesla.
